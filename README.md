# SCodeScanner

The SCodeScanner stands for Source Code Scanner, where you can scan your source code files like PHP and get identify the vulnerabilities inside it. The tool can use by Pentester, Developer to quickly identify the weakness.

## Features

The main features for this tool are:-

1) Scans the whole folder which contains multiple PHP files.
2) It will not only notify you at which file but also which line the vulnerable code exists for quickly identified it.
3) It runs on your localhost, where you will have to give the folder name for scans.
4) Give results out for each file inside the anchors tag (So you can move on to it.)
5) You can add more functions which are dangerous if you found missing any inside the vulnerablefunctions python file.

## How to run it?

## Future Work

For now, I have focused only on PHP, but in future, I will make this scanner for other languages too. Focused languages are:- PHP, ASP, PYTHON JAVA.
Let me know if anyone interested.

Also, I will update this tool regularly to make it more powerful.
