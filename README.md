# SCodeScanner

The SCodeScanner stands for Source Code Scanner, where you can scan your source code files like PHP and get identify the vulnerabilities inside it. The tool can use by Pentester, Developer to quickly identify the weakness.

The tool supports the semgrep integration.

## Features

New features are added on this tool.

1) Scans folder inside folder inside folder and so on..
2) Added more ways of finding user controlled variable, one eg:- `$x = $this->getRequest()->getParam('id')`
3) Integration of Semgrep
4) It will not only notify you at which file but also which line the vulnerable code exists for quickly identified it.
5) Results out in `.txt` file
6) Scan each variable in each file
7) Gives you the best results on the basis of rules defined in rules directory.

## How does it work?

1) There are number of yaml files inside rules directory those yaml files contains `$replace` which actually replaced with php variable for ex: `$uservar, $_GET['aaa']`. 

2) The variables are grepped by Regex and get replace the variables defined inside yaml files ($replace) and creates new yaml file inside `/temp` directory. 

3) Then this tool runs semgrep and use the temp directory as config path and start scanning the code.

## How to run it?

## Future Work

For now, I have focused only on PHP, but in future, I will make this scanner for other languages too. Focused languages are:- PHP, ASP, PYTHON JAVA.
Let me know if anyone interested.

Also, I will update this tool regularly to make it more powerful.
